# Documentation Strategy

_Last updated: <!-- Replace with current date -->_

**repobasedocs-version: v3.0.0** <!-- Update when synced with RepoBaseDocs CHANGELOG.md -->

This document defines **when and how** project documentation must be updated. It is the enforcement mechanism for the RepoBaseDocs framework. Agents and humans follow these rules to prevent documentation drift.

> **Adoption level:** This document is part of the **Full** adoption level. Projects at Lightweight (CLAUDE.md + BREADCRUMBS) or Standard (+ PROJECT_SPEC, EXECUTION_PLAN, PROJECT_STATE) do not need this file. If you copied this template from a shared docs source, keep a note in your project README or CLAUDE.md describing which adoption level this repo uses.

## Document Tiers

| Tier | Purpose | Documents |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Tier 0 — Agent Entry Point** | Auto-loaded by Claude Code at session start | `CLAUDE.md` (repo root) |
| **Tier 1 — Agent Input** | Consumed by executing agents during work | PROJECT_SPEC, EXECUTION_PLAN, OPEN_DECISIONS, BREADCRUMBS |
| **Tier 2 — Human Dashboard & Process** | Maintained as output; read by humans | PROJECT_STATE, CLOSED_DECISION_LOG, DOCS_STRATEGY |
| **Tier 3 — Implementation Artifacts** | Historical build records; not status trackers | `docs/plans/*` (design + implementation specs) |

`CLAUDE.md` is the agent onboarding document. It routes agents to EXECUTION_PLAN and PROJECT_STATE for status, BREADCRUMBS for gotchas, and includes key build/test commands and architecture context. It is auto-loaded into every Claude Code conversation.

Tier 1 documents are the specification chain. Quality gates in their templates enforce completeness.
Tier 2 documents track reality and process. They are updated as output of agent work, not consumed as input.
Tier 3 documents are implementation specs written before or during a feature build. Once the feature is complete, the plan doc is a historical artifact — **status lives only in EXECUTION_PLAN's Completed Work table**, not in plan doc headers. Do not rely on plan doc `Status:` lines for current project status.

> **TASK_BRIEFS.md** is available as an alternative to `docs/plans/*` for projects that prefer structured work packets in a single file. When using TASK_BRIEFS, it belongs in Tier 1. See RepoBaseDocs WORKFLOW.md Section 7 for the TASK_BRIEFS template and quality gates.

## Update Rules Per Document

### CLAUDE.md (repo root)

The **agent entry point** — auto-loaded into every Claude Code conversation. Keep it concise (routing document, not comprehensive reference). Update when build/test commands change, when architecture shifts significantly, or when new conventions/gotchas affect how agents should approach the codebase. Do not duplicate content from other docs — point to them instead.

### EXECUTION_PLAN.md

The execution plan is the **single source of truth** for what to build and in what order. Update it when phases complete (mark Done in the Completed Work table), when new phases are added (append a phase card), or when dependencies change. Never delete completed phases — they are the project's history. The acceptance criteria for each phase are binding; a phase is not Done until all criteria are met. **Status for completed work lives here, not in individual plan docs.**

### BREADCRUMBS.md

Breadcrumbs are **institutional memory**. Add entries when you discover something surprising (a gotcha), when you identify a pattern worth reusing, or when you complete a significant prompt exchange. Never delete gotchas -- they save future agents from repeating mistakes. Keep the File Map current when files are added, renamed, or deleted.

### PROJECT_STATE.md

Project state is the **dashboard**. It answers "where are we?" at a glance. Update at the start and end of every session. Move items between Active, Done, and Blocked as work progresses. Keep the Key Components table current. The "For New Agents" section is critical -- it defines the reading order for onboarding.

### OPEN_DECISIONS.md

Open decisions track **choices that block or shape work**. Add decisions as soon as they are identified, even before options are clear. When a project-level or formally reviewed decision is made, move it to the Decided section using the ADR format -- never delete the Open entry, replace it with an ADR. Include rationale and consequences so future agents understand *why*.

### PROJECT_SPEC.md

The root specification. Update when project intent, constraints, or scope boundaries change. Every change gets a dated entry in Evolution Notes. Planning agents verify the spec before writing new phases or task briefs.

### CLOSED_DECISION_LOG.md

Append-only during execution. Executing agents add entries when hitting forks not pre-resolved by task briefs or OPEN_DECISIONS defaults. Humans review periodically to promote recurring or project-shaping patterns to PROJECT_SPEC or OPEN_DECISIONS.

### docs/plans/* (Tier 3 — Implementation Artifacts)

Plan docs are **build records** — design rationale and implementation steps written before or during feature work. Once a feature is complete, the plan doc is a historical artifact. **Do not maintain `Status:` headers in plan docs as a status tracking mechanism.** Completion status lives only in EXECUTION_PLAN.md's Completed Work table. Agents should never determine project status by scanning plan doc headers.

### TASK_BRIEFS.md (if used)

Task briefs are **work packets** agents consume. Each brief must be self-contained: an agent should be able to read one brief and start working without asking questions. Update when a task completes (remove or mark done), when a new task is scoped (add a full brief), or when requirements change mid-flight. Every brief must have explicit File Ownership and Verification sections. Projects using `docs/plans/*` instead of TASK_BRIEFS may omit this document.

### DOCS_STRATEGY.md (this file)

Update this file when the documentation process itself changes — new triggers, new documents added to the set, or changes to the session handoff ritual.

---

## Session Handoff Ritual

Every agent must execute this protocol before ending a session. The purpose is to leave the project in a state where the next agent (or human) can pick up immediately without re-discovery.

### Before Ending Any Session

1. **What was done**: List completed work with commit references or file changes. Be specific: "Implemented Phase 7.1 bug fixes (commit abc1234)" not "fixed some bugs."

2. **What's in flight**: Any partially completed work, uncommitted changes, or experiments that didn't land. Include branch names if applicable.

3. **Test harness knowledge**: How to verify the system works right now. Include exact commands, expected output, and known failures. An agent should be able to copy-paste these commands and confirm the system is healthy.

4. **Gotchas encountered**: Anything surprising discovered during the session. Add these to BREADCRUMBS.md as well.

5. **Next steps**: The top 3-5 concrete actions for the next session, ordered by priority. Reference specific phases or tasks from EXECUTION_PLAN.md.

### Where to Record

- Update **PROJECT_STATE.md** with items 1, 2, and 5.
- Update **PROJECT_STATE.md** Quick Resume section if startup commands changed.
- Update **PROJECT_STATE.md** Last Session Summary section with date, accomplishments, in-flight work, and top 3 next steps.
- Update **BREADCRUMBS.md** with items 3 and 4 (add gotchas, update file map if files changed).
- If an execution-time fork was handled locally, append **CLOSED_DECISION_LOG.md**.
- If a new blocker was identified or a formal decision was resolved, update **OPEN_DECISIONS.md**.

## Agent Session Checklist

Use this checklist at the end of every agent session:

- [ ] PROJECT_STATE.md reflects current Active/Done/Blocked status
- [ ] Any new gotchas are recorded in BREADCRUMBS.md
- [ ] Any formal decisions are recorded in OPEN_DECISIONS.md as ADRs
- [ ] EXECUTION_PLAN.md phase statuses are current (Completed Work table updated)
- [ ] CLAUDE.md updated if build commands, architecture, or key conventions changed
- [ ] Session handoff information is recorded (what was done, what's next)
- [ ] Consult OPEN_DECISIONS for default assumptions on relevant decisions
- [ ] Execution-time forks are logged to CLOSED_DECISION_LOG

---

## Framework Sync Check

This project uses a RepoBaseDocs-derived template set. The framework evolves independently — new templates, updated guidance, and process changes are tracked in the source framework copy this project adopted from.

**repobasedocs-version** (at the top of this file) records which framework version this project has incorporated. When the framework advances past a client's version, unacknowledged changes should be surfaced as action items.

### Session-Start Protocol

At the start of a session (after reading project docs, before implementation work):

1. Read the `CHANGELOG.md` from your source copy of the framework
2. Compare the latest version against this file's `repobasedocs-version` marker
3. If this project is behind:
   - List the new CHANGELOG entries and their `Affects:` tags
   - Create action items for relevant changes (not all changes affect all clients)
   - After incorporating changes, bump the `repobasedocs-version` marker in this file
4. If current, no action needed — proceed with normal work

### When to Skip

- Skip this check if the session is a quick bug fix or the user explicitly says to skip onboarding
- The check is lightweight (read one file, compare one version) — it should not delay substantive work

---

## File Ownership Rules

To prevent agent collisions when multiple agents work in parallel:

- Each task (whether in TASK_BRIEFS.md or a plan doc) declares **explicit file ownership** — which files that task is allowed to modify.
- No two active tasks may own the same file. If overlap is unavoidable, one task must complete before the other starts (sequential gating).
- Shared files (like a main app entry point) should be owned by at most one task at a time. Other tasks that need changes to shared files should document their requirements and defer to the owning task.
- Documentation files (BREADCRUMBS.md, PROJECT_STATE.md) are append-only during parallel work — agents may add entries but should not reorganize or rewrite sections another agent might be reading.

---

## Staleness Prevention

Documentation decays when updates are deferred. These rules prevent it:

1. **No session ends without a PROJECT_STATE.md update.** This is non-negotiable.
2. **Gotchas are recorded immediately**, not "later." If you hit a surprising behavior, add it to BREADCRUMBS.md before moving on.
3. **Decisions are captured when identified**, not when resolved. An open decision with no options listed yet is still valuable -- it flags that a choice is needed.
4. **Monthly review**: If any document hasn't been updated in 30 days, review it for accuracy. Stale docs are worse than no docs.
5. **Dead content gets deleted**, not commented out. If a section is no longer relevant, remove it. Git history preserves the old version.

---

## Superseded Documents

When adopting RepoBaseDocs in an existing project, or when documentation evolves, old documents may be replaced by framework equivalents. Track all document transitions in three categories.

### Superseded (Replaced by Framework Equivalents)

<!-- Replace: Add rows as documents are superseded during migration. -->

| Old Document | Replaced By | Migration Date |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| <!-- Replace --> | <!-- Replace --> | <!-- Replace --> |

### Superseded Notice Template

Add this notice to the top of any document that has been replaced:

```markdown
> **SUPERSEDED**: This document has been replaced by `<new-document>.md`.
> Content has been migrated as of <date>. This file is retained for
> reference only — do not update it. See `<new-document>.md` for the
> current version.
```

### Documents Retained As-Is (Not Superseded)

<!-- Replace: Documents with domain-specific content referenced from
framework docs but not replaced by them. -->

| Document | Reason Retained |
|----------|----------------|
| <!-- Replace --> | <!-- Replace --> |

### Documents Removed (Historical References Only)

<!-- Replace: Documents deleted during restructures. Note which Tier 1
docs still reference them for historical context. -->

| Document | Was | Removed |
|----------|-----|---------|
| <!-- Replace --> | <!-- Replace --> | <!-- Replace --> |

### Rules

1. **Always add a notice before archiving.** Never silently delete or move a document that team members may reference. The notice redirects them to the correct location.
2. **Move to `archive/` if the project root becomes cluttered.** Superseded documents with notices can stay in place or be moved to an `archive/` directory. Either is acceptable — consistency within the project matters more than the specific choice.
3. **Never delete superseded documents outright.** Git history is not a substitute for discoverability. A developer searching for `ARCHITECTURE.md` should find a redirect, not a 404. Delete only after the entire team has transitioned (typically 2+ months).
