# Agent-docs

Reusable instruction and template files for Claude Code projects. These are a continually evolving project, and feedback on contents, best practices or your own use experiences are more than welcome.

## Motivation

Centralize baseline instructions, coding guidelines, and document templates for efficient reuse.

## How It Works

The main file, `claude.md` should be attached to Claude Code via startup hook. It directs Claude to consult the files in this repository depending on task. Template files provide additional standardized formats for commits, architectural decision records, conversation summaries, bug audits, and READMEs.

## Project Structure

- `claude.md` shared Claude Code instructions referenced by default
- `code-style-short.md` Python coding conventions and anti-patterns
- `packages.md` package structure and module organization guidelines
- `planning.md` project development pipeline and planning document formats
- `template-commit.md` commit message format
- `template-adr.md` architectural decision record format
- `template-conversation.md` conversation summary format
- `template-audit-bug.md` bug audit report format
- `template-readme.md` README format for projects and sub-packages
- `ComplementaryDocsToAgentDocs/` project specification and state tracking templates adapted from RepoBaseDocs

## Setup

To use this package, you must:

- Add `claude.md` as a startup hook (or point to it via package level CLAUDE.md)
- replace example local paths with your clone path throughout
- remove or replace specialized tool instructions (search for e.g. python3 in md files)

How to configure the hook in Claude Code's global settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`):
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "startup": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "cat /path/to/agent-docs/claude.md"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
